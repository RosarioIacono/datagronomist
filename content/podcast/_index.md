## A call for voices

The *Datagronomist* podcast is not only about results, technologies, or success stories.  
It is about **people who carry more than one language inside them** — science and something else.

I am looking to speak with scientists, researchers, and practitioners whose paths into science were shaped by **unusual backgrounds or transitions**:  
growing up on a farm, working in the petroleum or chemical industry, coming from crafts, activism, art, or other worlds that left a trace on how you think and work today.

What interests me is not only *what* you research, but **how your biography shapes the questions you ask**, the compromises you make, and the futures you imagine for agriculture, plants, and the environment.

Conversations will be slow, reflective, and open-ended — closer to a long coffee than to an interview.  
No soundbites, no performance, no need to simplify what matters.

If this resonates with you, or if you know someone whose story should be told, feel free to get in touch.
