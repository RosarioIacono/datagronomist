I work across research, public engagement, and interdisciplinary practice.  
Below is a selection of ongoing and recent projects that reflect this trajectory.

## Neuland  
**Scientific Coordinator — main role**

An interdisciplinary initiative at the Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research (IPK), developed in collaboration with Burg Giebichenstein University of Art and Design Halle.  
Neuland explores new ways of connecting plant science, design, and public discourse, with a focus on knowledge transfer, reflection, and societal engagement.
