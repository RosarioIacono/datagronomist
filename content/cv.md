## Rosario Iacono  
**Scientific Coordinator · Agronomist · Researcher · Open-Source Advocate**

---

I am a scientist and scientific coordinator working at the intersection of **plant science, agriculture, public engagement, and interdisciplinary collaboration**.  
My work combines active research experience with a strong focus on **knowledge transfer**, science communication, and the translation of complex research into formats that foster dialogue between science and society.
