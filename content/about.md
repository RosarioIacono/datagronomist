My background is in environmental and plant research, but my path has always unfolded along a thin line: between doing science and thinking about what science does in the world. Between data, soil, and plants on one side — and questions of meaning, responsibility, and communication on the other.

I believe that producing knowledge is only the first step. For science to matter, it must be translated, opened, and placed in dialogue with society. This blog is my attempt to explore that process: how scientific insights travel beyond academia, how they change when they meet art, design, and lived experience, and how they can help us imagine more sustainable and humane futures.

Here I write about agriculture, data, plants, and ecosystems — but also about uncertainty, collaboration, and the craft of making knowledge shareable. Datagronomist is not about final answers, but about learning in public, walking the rope between rigor and creativity, and staying curious about what comes next.
